# Assessment of Android Applications

• Risk management approach to assess mobile applications intrusiveness to end-users’ private sphere.  
• Rely on applications’s static features (permissions, APIs), as their innate features to compute their
intrusiveness using an entropy based heuristic metric.  
• Custom made architecture for automatic mobile application feature extraction and validation on
two application groups, Google’s Play top 100 apps and 100 malware apps.
